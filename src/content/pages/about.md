## Elias Fahssi - Strategic Marketer based in Calgary

**Greetings!** I'm Elias Fahssi, a passionate reader, writer, and marketer residing in Canada's sunniest city, [Calgary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary). With a keen eye for design and a love for connecting the dots, I bring a unique blend of creativity and critical thinking to the world of storytelling and persuasion.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in go-to-market and product management + marketing. My proficiency includes **product launches**, **positioning and messaging**, **competitive intelligence**, and tools such as **Miro** for dynamic and interactive facilitation, working meetings, and discovery sessions. On the customer side, I'm well-versed in sales enablement, client and project management, public speaking, and event strategy.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I thrive on simplifying complex problems and transforming ideas from different groups into something functional and coherent. Whether it's managing a roadmap, rebuilding a website, or helping a deal across the line, I approach each challenge with a mindset of **how can I help?** or **I don't know, but I'll find out**.

## Global Perspective, Local Impact

Living in Calgary but studying and working internationally has not only influenced my appreciation for storytelling and the humanities but has also shaped my approach to business and growth. I understand the importance of meeting people where they are, and the power of context in communication.

## Continuous Learning and the Arts

An English nerd at heart, the power of language and storytelling inspires me to stay up-to-date with both my niche research areas and the world of tech and B2B marketing. I found my home at the intersection of marketing, product, and strategy because it combines so many areas I loved about academia and my research. I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace emerging technologies and frameworks that enhance the functionality and aesthetics of my work.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe in the power of collaboration, coaching, and _Playing to Win_. Whether working with clients, designers, engineers, or fellow marketers and product people, I value clear expectations and committment to an excellent result.
