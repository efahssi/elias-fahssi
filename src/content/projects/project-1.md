## Project Overview

_Cotton Nero A.x._ is a 14th century manuscript in the <a href='https://digitalcollections.ucalgary.ca/archive/Gawain-Manuscript-2R3BF1FK246CX.html' target='_blank'>British Library</a>. It is the only existing copy of four important Middle English poems: _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_, _Pearl_, _Patience_, and _Cleanness_. The Project captured high-quality digital photographs of the entire manuscript; transcribed the entire manuscript at the highest possible level of accuracy and detail; and published critical editions of each of the individual poems. We used XML to describe manuscript features, and provided descriptions of the script and writing.

## Objectives

1. Use digital technology to make the manuscript more accessible to researchers and the public
2. Transcribe every letter of the manuscript using markup language (XML + XSLT)
3. Publish definitive critical ditions informed by detailed analysis of the manuscript (aided by multispectral photography)
