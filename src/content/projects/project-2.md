## Project Overview

People didn't know DIRTT sold cabinets. Cabinets and storage were a small and consistent part of the business' product mix; unfortunately, we heard too often at the end of a project: "we didn't know you made those." We changed the name from _Millwork_ to _Casework_, which cleared up confusion among architects, and relaunched the portfolio with a new set of marketing assets and sales tools.

To support the launch, we doubled-down on a key segment: Healthcare. This decision formed the basis for a 5-year growth strategy focused on increasing the % of cabinets and storage on each project from 4% to 12%.

## Objectives

1. Change the product name to align with the architectural industry's standard definition
2. Differentiate our storage solution from the competition (custom cabinet makers, other manufacturers, and local design-builders)
3. Reintroduce ourselves to the market with a targeted campaign and sales enablement program
